Hylle(r) til verb
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'hylle(r)' with a random verb.

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag HylleTilVerb.crx into the page that appears.
